# Development Log

## 2024-02-19

### Project Initialization
- Set up basic project structure
- Created requirements.txt with essential dependencies:
  - streamlit for the web interface
  - pandoc for document conversion
  - python-magic for file type detection

### Initial Application Setup
- Created app.py with basic Streamlit UI
- Implemented file upload functionality
- Added file type detection using python-magic
- Set up temporary file handling with cleanup

### Next Steps
- Implement pandoc format detection
- Add conversion options based on input file type
- Add conversion functionality
- Implement file download feature

### Technical Decisions
1. Using python-magic for reliable file type detection instead of relying on file extensions
2. Implementing temporary file storage with automatic cleanup to handle file uploads safely
3. Chose Streamlit for rapid UI development and easy deployment
4. Removed python-magic-bin dependency in favor of system libmagic for better compatibility
